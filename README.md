# Loves me not

```text
I complicated our lives
by falling in love with him
I complicated our lives
now I am losing my only friend
I do not know why, I had to try
living my life on the other side
now I am so confused
I do not know what to do
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me...
I started blurring the lines
because I did not care
I started crossing the line
cause you were never there
no where to turn,
no one to help,
it is almost like I do not even know myself
now I have to choose
I do not know what to do
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me ......
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me......
no where to turn,
no one to help,
it is almost like I do not even know myself
now I have to choose
I do not know what to do
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
he loves me, he loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
loves me not...
